## Short Description of the System
This  Python-based console-application simulates a Computer Device Management System by using the principles   of object-oriented programming. In this program the abstract base class is  ``` python ComputerDevice``` and its subclasses includes Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor, Speaker, SystemUnit, and Webcam which contains their unique attributes and behaviors. To allow users to interact with the devices, it will display a text-based menu to show its functionalities such as, viewing its specifications, performing operations like turning on/off, typing, adjusting settings and other particular methods. This project demonstrates class inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism in a structured and practical way.
