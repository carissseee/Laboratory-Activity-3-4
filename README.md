# Computer Device
## Laboratory-Activity-3 & 4

## Short Description of the System
This  Python-based console-application simulates a Computer Device Management System by using the principles   of object-oriented programming. In this program the abstract base class is '''Python ComputerDevice''' and its subclasses includes Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor, Speaker, SystemUnit, and Webcam which contains their unique attributes and behaviors. To allow users to interact with the devices, it will display a text-based menu to show its functionalities such as, viewing its specifications, performing operations like turning on/off, typing, adjusting settings and other particular methods. This project demonstrates class inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism in a structured and practical way.
